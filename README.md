# dexteditor
## General information
dexteditor is the updated java implementation of my texteditor learning project for my work. It uses plain textfields to visualize any text file and is heavily inspired by the default windows texteditor. It is developed as a playground for new learned stuff.

## Notes
### Build and execution
At the moment there is no way to build the application or create an executable jar/file of the project. The only workaround is to run the gradle task ':run' in eclipse after cloning the repository locally.

## Goals
- [ ] Write unit tests for code
- [ ] Use MVVM pattern
- [ ] Analyse for clean code (enable sonarqube scanning for project)
- [ ] Build executable application
- [ ] Try CI-build (with Jenkins)
