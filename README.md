# About
texteditor is the updated Java implementation of my custom built learning project for my work. It uses a plain text area to visualize any text file and is heavily inspired by the default Windows 10 texteditor. My intention is to use this as a playground for learning.

# Notes
## Build and execution
At the moment there is no way to build the application or create an executable jar/file of the project. The only workaround is to run the gradle task ':run' in eclipse after cloning the repository locally.
